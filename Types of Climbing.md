# **Different Types of Rocking Climbing**
---
## There are many different varieties of climbing, and they all involve different technique used, gear required, and challenges involved. 

1. **Bouldering**: Bouldering is a very niche type of rock climbing, one where you are not attached to any rope, and only stay on the wall by your own body strength. WHen you bouldering, you do not get very high off the ground, and normally have padding to fall onto underneath you. Bouldering only requires climbing shoes and some chalk. It can be done indoors or outdoors. If you decide to do boulder outdoors however, you will need to add a padded mat to your list of gear.

2. **Top Roping**: Top Roping is a great introduction to climbing for beginners. It involves the rope already being attached to the top of the wall, and so all the climber needs to worry about is getting attached to the rope at the bottom, and then getting up the wall. Top roping usually involves climbing anywhere from 30-60 feet, and so decent endurance is needed. Top roping can be done indoors and outdoors, and requires rope, a belay device (for moving the rope slack through), a harness, climbing shoes, and chalk.

3. **Lead Climbing**: Lead Climbing is a very advanced form of climbing. It involves the climber attached themselves to different checkpoints on their way up the wall. If they fall, they will fall to where they previously clipped in. Lead climbing is very physically and mentally challenging. It requires all of the same gear as top roping, but in addition a climber should wear a helmet, and will need clips called quick draws to hook into the wall.

4. **Trad Climbing**: Trad Climbing is nearly identical to lead climbing, expcept the check points that the climber needs to clip into on their way up the wall are placed there by the climber themselves. This requires much more gear, and can be extremely dangerous if done incorrectly. Trad climbing is normally done in places where people don't normally climb. It is strictly done outside.

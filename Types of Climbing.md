# **Different Types of Rocking Climbing**
---
## There are many different varieties of climbing, and they all involve different technique used, gear required, and challenges involved. 

1. Bouldering: bouldering is a very niche type of rock climbing, one where you are not attached to any rope, and only stay on the wall by your own body strength. WHen you bouldering, you do not get very high off the ground, and normally have padding to fall onto underneath you. Bouldering only requires climbing shoes and some chalk. It can be done indoors or outdoors. If you decide to do boulder outdoors however, you will need to add a padded mat to your list of gear.
